# Ridge-and-Lasso
This repository contains an example of Ridge and Lasso Regression
When There is an overfitting condition(i.e training data produces less error but test data produces large error ) occurs in Linear Regression,we get a steep lined as our 
best fit line.To minimize the error we use Ridge and lasso Regression.In ridge we minimize (y-y')^2 + lambda *(slope)^2 and in Lasso we minimize (y-y')^2+lambda*|slope|.
